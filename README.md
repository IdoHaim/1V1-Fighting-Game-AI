"# 1V1-Fighting-Game-AI"
The AI model in this project uses Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) to enhance the behavior of the AI characters during gameplay. The model is able to make decisions and improve its actions based on the rewards it receives. However, the current implementation does not store the knowledge or learned data across sessions. This means that every time the game is restarted, the AI starts from scratch and must relearn everything from the beginning. Ideally, the AI should save its learned knowledge (such as Q-values) to a persistent storage, allowing it to continue learning and improving over time, even after the game is closed or restarted.
